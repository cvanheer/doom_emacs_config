This is a copy of my doom emacs config which is set up to do the following:
- General GTD agenda
- Latex / thesis writing with integration with bibtex (using biblatex) - this can be done via .tex or via exporting to orgmode using org-latex-classes
- elfeed - RSS feed reader which allows ranking of papers in preprint servers - this is a WIP
- I do not use org-roam or org-capture stuff at the moment as it's not as useful to me anymore and I am transitioning my second brain to logseq
